# <h1 align= 'center'> Redesign-Google-Meet-app </h1>

This project provides a case study of UI/UX. In this project, I attempted to rebuild the Google Meet mobile app. For this project, I done numerous user research by questioning colleagues, professors, and students about the difficulties they encountered when using the Google Meet application and what new features they expected to see. This project was created using the Figma tool.
